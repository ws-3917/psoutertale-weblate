"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Hey.\n"
"* You're pretty cool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Just remember, if you get in a fight with someone, god or otherwise..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Remember to hold [X] to move twice as slowly.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Get away from me, man!\n"
"* I don't like you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I heard if you hold [X] in battle, you'll move twice"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I know... lame, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But I'll tell you a secret.\n"
"* That dog over there... won't expect you to move slowly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* If you sneak up on him while holding [X], you might just get by "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Guh huh huh... good luck."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* So you came back to talk, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's cool."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not as cool as me, but still pretty cool anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Very important."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Didn't you hear me?\n"
"* Get away!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You're gonna need it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I'm ice cold."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/3}{#npc/a}* Yo, this kid came up to me and stuck something "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* Then, he went off to the Foundry so he could \"boost the "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* ... kids can be so weird sometimes."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/3}{#npc/a}* Yo, everyone ran away and hid somewhere."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* You've got gumption walking in here after that, kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We all saw what happened on that TV screen up there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It's surprising to see Sans back here after what "
"happened last time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... actually, perhaps that's not too surprising."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* In the end, I never caught any \"girls\" on my "
"voice-mail."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So kid, take it from me..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Don't try to catch fantastic space creatures with just your voice-"
"mail."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Where the heck is Sans?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He told me he had a star chart I could use to find girls..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I mean, it was probably some kind of prank, but I wanted to know what "
"the prank was!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I put out a call for some \"girls\" today."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Someone told me there are infinite possibilities among the stars..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Well, I'm taking that seriously."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm literally going to make out with a space creature."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Wanna know what I think?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... that robot was the one guy who made me wanna call for boys instead"
" of girls."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's sad to see him go."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* You're talking to me like you want the inside scoop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Sorry kid.\n"
"* Guess you'll just have to wait for the next news update."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you, there was a single missed call..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... from a certain \"ONIONSAN.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* They didn't leave me any voice-mail though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Do you know where Sans is?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I guess I could ask Undyne.\n"
"* But I think she likes someone else already."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Here's hoping another cutie like him comes along..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Don't tell me you don't have an OuterNet account..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* What's an onionsan, anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Let me know if you see him..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Can I ever find love out here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Hmm..."
msgstr "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Hmm..."

msgid "<32>* I wonder what kind of food robots like."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Do they even eat food at all?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... we'll never know, now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Sans has been a regular here since day one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He usually orders the worst item off the menu..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Except for earlier today..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... when he ordered the SECOND worst item off the menu instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's something, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* He always orders the worst item off the menu, and he never pays his "
"tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But because he attracts so many other customers..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Grillby even gave him special arrangements."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... what's a \"yamok\" anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I wonder what a human bully would taste like..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Are they tastier when they're meaner?\n"
"* Or vice-versa?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* As much as I would've liked to try human food..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Food from a whole new world... now that's even better."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Hmmm, this is around the time that Sans comes in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Then, a little bit later, his brother comes in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Yes, his brother.\n"
"* Papyrus."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* He always used to order milk, but nowadays, he picks a new item every "
"time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That replicator sure is a wonderous thing, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's too bad it only produces monster food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Hmmm...\n"
"* Isn't human food different from monster food?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It does things like \"spoil.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And while monster food converts to energy instantly..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Human food has to pass all the way through their bodies first."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Which it somehow does, even on low gravity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* How strange.\n"
"* I'd love to try it sometime."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* How unfortunate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Come to think of it, that's not the only off-putting"
" thing to have happened today..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* How strange."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* We're blessed to have such a character in our midst."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* For all we know, a last-minute redemption could make"
" them the tastiest of all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* For all we know, new world food spoils even faster "
"than food made by humans."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I hope he shows up today.\n"
"* Him and his brother are great at making us laugh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I've also heard they have things called "
"\"bathrooms.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* How delightful."
