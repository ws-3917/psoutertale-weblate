msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* well, the only person we called who was available..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* a former elite squad member..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* turned out to be a massive trojan horse."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* the moment they were left alone with the souls..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* they took them, and turned themselves from a dummy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* into mad mew mew, from mew mew starfire."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* also known as the best movie in the mew mew franchise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* which i definitely didn't say because i'm afraid for my"
" life."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* anyway, as you can tell, things are just wonderful "
"here!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* rather than doing any important work, we all just play "
"games."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... which we definitely aren't forced into doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i mean, hey.\n"
"* at least the games are always fair."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* no, really.\n"
"* that's not even a lie."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* 'cause, even when she acts like she WANTS them to be "
"unfair..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* it's like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* something within her won't let her go that far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* something stops her.\n"
"* she hesitates, or even backpedals at times."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* there was this one time where, she had an idea..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* for a game where we'd all fight to the death in rounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but just as the match was about to start..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* she changed the rules to make it a fight to knockout "
"instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* so...\n"
"* if i had to guess..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* i'd say the human souls gave her more than she "
"bargained for."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* maybe some part of them remains conscious...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/17}* Uh, not to interrupt, but it's your move."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/18}* The game's all in your hands now!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... i see."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i guess i better get out there, then."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* That would probably be a good idea."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* For all our sakes."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but before i go."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* if this call ever reaches you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i suggest not letting another human get near us."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* mew mew's planning something big.\n"
"* i can feel it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* if she succeeds, the whole galaxy might be in danger."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* ... just thought i'd give you a heads up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* Come on, let's go!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i'm on my way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* so, after you left, things weren't too great at first."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/4}* but who would we hire to watch over them?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* well, of all the people we called, only charles took "
"the job."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* a little mouse with a spotless service record at the "
"core."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* now, charles had worked at the core for so long..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* that it grew accustomed with its routine."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* take a power cell out, put a new one back in..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* except now, instead of power cells, it was human souls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... so, when it accidentally absorbed those souls..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* it was only because charles was just doing what it knew"
" best."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i know.\n"
"* it sounds bad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* without the human souls, how would we escape?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but when that little mouse realized its new godlike "
"power..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* it used that power to make everyone's dreams come true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}HELLO, HUMAN!\n"
"IT IS I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}BY OUR ONE TRUE OVERLORD, KING CHARLES!!!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}YEAH, WE DON'T NEED TO SEE THE STARS!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* my thoughts exactly."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* after alphys became queen, she started making some "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* for one, the royal guard became the royal defense "

msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* it's hard to tell."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... though, i know one person she'll never forgive."

"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* at least he's happy.\n"
"* he really enjoys what he does."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* people were dead... others were hurt, or scared..."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* as it turns out, though, a lot of people felt the same"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* and all of us who did formed a support group for fans "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* remember his last words?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* \"you'll realize not everything's going to go your "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* even king asgore couldn't stop you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* but those nine words... became our group's mantra."

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* she got laughed all the way back to the outlands."

"<32>{#p/napstablook}* eventually, our group noticed that asgore had yet to "

"<32>{#p/napstablook}* as the \"face\" of the group, i was appointed as the "

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* a little weird having all these people look up to me, "

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Anyway!\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* They were all asleep in some weird archive thing.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* All I know is, I get to take care of a human!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It was Doge's idea.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* They're like pets???"

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Don't worry, we don't mistreat them.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It's perfect.\n"
"* Nobody breaks the rules."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Except those pesky shopkeepers at the rec center."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* THEY'RE JUST LAZY AND DISORGANIZED!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But they sell cool junk, so we give them a pass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Hold on.\n"
"* Are we giving anyone else a pass??"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* WHAT HAS OUR SOCIETY COME TO!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Doggo, new job for you!)\n"
"* (Spider queen, stirring up trouble again.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (A punishment is required!)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ... ugh.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Tall skeleton sets a very good example!)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* At this rate, he'll be on the dog council himself."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Well, I guess I'll have to end the message here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Have fun out there, wherever you are."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ... I'd give the phone back to that annoying dog, but the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* OK already!\n"

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Oh, who am I kidding~\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I just wanted to let you know about all the fun you're "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* So, after you departed from the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* By line of succession, Alphys was put in charge as queen~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But you see, dearie, she didn't think she could do it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Don't blame her though~\n"
"* She let her pet TV star die such a tragic death!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Don't blame her though~\n"
"* Without big boy Asgore to hold her hand, she was helpless!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It's so unfortunate there was nobody left to take charge, "
"don't you think?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Lucky for her, I was more than willing to appoint myself~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ahuhuhu~\n"
"* She rejected me at first, but after a little \"persuasion...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* She was quite eager to hand the outpost over to me!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* She held a meeting with the royal guards to hire someone "
"else, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Without their captain, they'd fallen into disorder!\n"
"* They needed direction~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ahuhuhu~\n"
"* Thankfully, I was more than willing to give it to them!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* And from there, the outpost was all but mine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* With your killing and bullying, the people were made so "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* With your bullying, the people were made so afraid and "
"obedient~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Like they were just begging for a strong, assertive leader "
"to take her rightful place!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* It's incredible just how quickly they all came around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* For that, dearie, I have you to thank~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* Oh, come ON.\n"
"* You think you can just blame it all on THEM?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Oh, dearie...\n"
"* It's a shame you're not here to see this~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Not only do the people do whatever I want, whenever I "
"want..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But some of them even do it willingly!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Most of them still whine and complain like babies, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* Well GEE, I wonder why THAT might be."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Oh, Alphys-dear~\n"
"* Didn't I tell you to clean out the fluid network today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* It's gotten so dirty after all these years..."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* If you don't clean it, then who will?"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/22}* I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Oh, you ARE such a pest, aren't you~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* But... ahuhuhu~\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/2}* ... n-no, please, I..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/3}* I-I'll do it!\n"
"* You just watch me, I'll do it right now!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Too late, Alphys-dear~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Spiders, take her away!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It would seem she needs another stay in the Aurora Zone~"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/22}* No, PLEASE!!\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* See you on the other side~"

msgid "<26>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* Maybe you'd like to try."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Oh, but you know that'll never happen~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And... ahuhuhu~\n"

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/28}* Eheh...\n"
"* Maybe you'll be the one who's in trouble soon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Enough talk, Alphys-dear~\n"
"* I know exactly what kind of punishment you deserve!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/29}* Enjoy your last moments in power."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#s/spiderLaugh}* Like I'd fall for that~"

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ahuhuhu~\n"
"* Poor Alphys-dear, always getting into trouble~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It's a good thing we have the Aurora Zone to straighten out "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* With the power of the archive, we can send a monster into a "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it'd been so long since the last human arrived, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* considering what we recently found out about humanity..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* about how they all left the home galaxy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it's a miracle you even came to the outpost at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oh yeah, about my cousins..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* after the whole mettaton thing, it's been going pretty good."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* we've been talking it over, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... we've decided to re-open the snail farm here on eurybia."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* mettaton's doing the advertising, while i and the others look after "
"the snails."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* we even found a place we could stay once we get settled in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* a very kind house told us we could live there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* apparently, it's the same one undyne used to live in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oh right... my cousins."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i don't really know if i should be telling you this, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* we sort of figured out that mettaton might be our long-lost cousin."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* the others and i tried to ask him about it, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... it didn't really go the way we'd hoped."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* then, everyone was blaming each other for messing it up..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i... haven't felt like talking with them since."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* yeah... this was a bad topic"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* speaking of family..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* hey...\n"
"* even if my family's not doing too well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that human i adopted is... really something, heh"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* they say i'm their favorite monster..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... knowing what they went through in the archive, that really means "
"something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and... they always find a way to make me smile."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* like, a few hours ago, when the walls were still being put in..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* they wanted to go outside to see the construction before it was too "
"late."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* when i said they could, they were so happy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* now i finally understand why people like raising children."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/napstablook}* i guess i should be thankful..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* to asgore, i mean"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* he and alphys were the ones who trusted me to adopt this human."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* i... also found out he was the hairy guy who came to our farm all the "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* he'd always take such good care of the snails he purchased..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* even healing them if they ever got hurt before dying of natural "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* for someone like him... to trust me with something like this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well... i know he'll take really good care of you, at least."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* you might not have any siblings, but..."
msgstr ""

"<32>{#p/napstablook}* you know...\n"
"* before the snail farm, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* before the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* my life on the old homeworld was a quiet one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that old homeworld..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it really was a special place."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* the way the sky set itself on fire every day..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* how everyone who lived there was so at peace before the war..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* back then, i didn't think anything of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* now... after nearly two hundred years of captivity......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i realized i'd been taking it all for granted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* well, anyway.\n"
"* the old homeworld was great and all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* but the new one's got a lot going for it, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* like the wildlife."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* when i traveled the surface earlier, i ran into some of it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and that's when i saw something interesting happen"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* the creatures... starting using magic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* when i mentioned this to alphys, she said the planet didn't have any "
"magic..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* not according to the scans they took when we first arrived."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* has our arrival to this world..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... given it something it didn't have before?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... heh."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i've been rambling a lot, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i appreciate you listening to me, though"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it's really nice of you to do that for me, frisk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* just wanted you to know that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* huh?\n"
"* you still wanted to talk?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* oh......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i guess i ran out of conversation topics"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i doubt i'd have anything else of interest to say, so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* feel free to go do something else, now"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... frisk, uh..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i'm not really sure what to talk about anymore"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* maybe... if you come back later today..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* i'll think of something else..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... oh........."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* you're.........\n"
"* still here........."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* even though i have nothing else to say........."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well... i guess, if you just wanted my company... then..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* feel free to stick around a while longer"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* actually..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... would you like me to tell you a joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i don't have much of a sense of humor, but i can try..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay...\n"
"* here goes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a ghost gets tired in the middle of the road, what does it do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... it {@fill=#ff0}naps to block{@fill=#fff} you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* get it?\n"
"* napstablook?\n"
"* naps to block?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* yeah...\n"
"* that was kinda bad"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... you wanted me to tell you another joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* hmm... let me think about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay, let's see..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a ghost changed vessels so they could have a child, what would you "
"call it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... a {@fill=#ff0}trans-parent.{@fill=#fff}."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... heh."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... you wanted me to tell you a third joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well... if you insist..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay.\n"
"* i've got it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a restaurant hires a ghost to taste test their food, what does that"
" make the ghost?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... a {@fill=#ff0}food-in-spectre.{@fill=#fff}."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* alright, alright.\n"
"* maybe i got a little carried away with that one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* but i hope you liked it anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* oh..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... i guess i'm at a loss for what to say."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* you've been such a good listener, i'd feel bad if i ran out of ideas."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* c'mon, blooky, think..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... what can you talk about..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* wait, hold on"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* do you know anything about ghost food?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that last joke kind of got me thinking about it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* you must be confused... it's not really explained anywhere."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* if you like, i can tell you about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... so, ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it's exactly like normal monster food, except..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* when preparing it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* there's a special kind of spell you have to use to make it edible for "
"ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that's right... any monster food can become ghost food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* as it turns out, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* certain kinds of food are easier to convert than others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* like... standard fruit.\n"
"* or milkshakes."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* but something like that exoberry pie you bought from me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* but something like that exoberry pie i had in my shop..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that... would take a lot of magical power to make."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* the more complicated the food, the more difficult it is to convert "
"into ghost food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* this one time, my... er, mettaton made me a chocolate "
"cake."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* this one time, my cousin made me a chocolate cake."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* chocolate filling, chocolate icing... chocolate everything."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* if i didn't know any better, i'd think it was actual human food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* but somehow, he managed to convert all of that into a ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* not for a special occasion, but just because he wanted to see me "
"smile."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* but somehow, they managed to convert all of that into a ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* not for a special occasion, but just because they wanted to see me "
"smile."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* well... i did.\n"
"* and we ate the cake together."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and i was happy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* heh...\n"
"* i think i'm gonna pretend to sleep for a while..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it helps me unwind after a long day like this one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... wait, it's morning..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i guess that would make it a long night, then."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* days and nights...\n"
"* that's going to take some getting used to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well... thanks for talking to me, frisk"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* feel free to lay down next to me... if you like......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Zzz... Zzz..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* Zzz... Zzz..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid "Yes"
msgstr "Igen"

msgid "No"
msgstr "Nem"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The ghost is still here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oooooooooooo......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* this is really nice......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (You feel... something.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* oh, sorry... i should probably explain what this is..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ...\n"
"* so, uh..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* i took your body...\n"
"* as a vessel..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and now...... we inhabit the same space......"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* i don't know why, but the last human who tried this... really liked "
"it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* maybe you will too..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* well, we can stay like this as long as you don't try "
"to move."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* so...\n"
"* only try to move around when you want it to end, i guess."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* well...\n"
"* i hope you liked that..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* or at least found it kind of interesting..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* or something..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (But you didn't feel like wasting your time here.)"

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ah, the humble hallway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* For Asriel and I, it was the starting point of countless adventures..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* ... running dauntlessly across the various rooms of the house."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I know, right?\n"
"* So very adventurous."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Sadly, we had to stop after the mirror got smashed in for the seven "
"hundredth time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You wouldn't believe the excuses I'd come up with..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Like when I blamed a particle collider for shooting a stray atom from "
"Earth to the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* And somehow only hitting the glass because it \"phased\" through the "
"wall."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah... that one might've been a stretch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Nowadays, though, hallways are just hallways."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And excuses are just excuses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Is there a valuable life lesson in there somewhere?\n"
"* Probably."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I will say, there's a kind of symbolism to a ghost in a hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With the whole \"between one place and another\" thing going on."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Actually, that probably only applies to human ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Monster ghosts are just born like that naturally..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* So, if anything, they'd be in the room at the beginning of the "
"hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... rather than standing in the middle of it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Sorry.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But what did you expect me to go on when you spoke to me in a boring "
"hallway?"
msgstr ""

"<33>* Boring hallway, boring tangent.\n"

msgstr ""

"<32>{#p/basic}* ... wait, I know!\n"
"* We could go to a new room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ooh... Asgore's room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The big guy sure loves his diaries, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Even though he hasn't written anything into that one yet, I'm sure "
"he'll do so soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Reading them has always been a guilty pleasure of mine..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* What?\n"
"* Everyone's got some kind of guilty pleasure, don't they?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what yours would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Maybe I'll find out later."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* For now, though, I'll just be hanging around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Watching, waiting..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... ready to catch you the moment you do something you don't want me "
"to see!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Okay, maybe I wouldn't actually go that far."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* Not while you're awake, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I took a peek outside, and they're STILL working on "
"construction."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The whole front of the house is STILL a big mess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And Asgore's... STILL tending to the ground..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... while the former CORE workers take their sweet, sweet time "
"building the porch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what it'll look like when it's done..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Hopefully, with Asgore in charge, it'll look better than what we've "
"had before."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Actually, Asgore's only in charge of the design."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Since construction started yesterday, Doge has been the one giving the"
" orders."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I snuck outside then, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She's strict, but she seems to know what she's doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Which is great, because as much as I love Asgore for who he is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He most certainly is NOT your ideal foreman."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* Speaking of things being built, they finished the balcony "
"earlier this morning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Monster Kid and Asriel are both outside...\n"
"* ... sightseeing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* They sure do that a lot together... they're probably waiting for you "
"to join them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Once you're done taking in YOUR surroundings, you could go see them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Or you could just go back to your room.\n"
"* Whatever floats your hoverboat."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh yeah, about boats..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I guess those aren't really needed around here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But... Frisk!\n"
"* There are places on this world you can't be without one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Especially the bog basins.\n"
"* All that murky water..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Just keep it in mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And no, you can't just get by swimming in those kinds of "
"places."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Only some of them.\n"
"* And only at a good time of day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Mind you, do monsters even have a sense of the time of day?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Most WERE born in space..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... maybe that's a question for another time of day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Three little chairs at the dining table..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* One for you, one for Asriel, and one for Monster Kid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* That's fine, really.\n"
"* Asgore wouldn't know I'm here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Still..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It does feel strange not to have a place there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Asriel and I loved to swap the chairs around when Mom wasn't"
" looking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Even Asgore would get in on it sometimes.\n"
"* She... wasn't impressed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But it was all in good fun."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Heck, he used to check under Asriel's chair for space creatures when "
"he sat down."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I'll never forget that time Toriel sat down on the chair, which we "
"swapped beforehand..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Asgore gave her the exact same treatment, and it was GLORIOUS."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* All of us were laughing... except for Toriel, who sat there in "
"disbelief."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Well.\n"
"* She came around to it later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* But, yeah... she wasn't much for the chicanery we got up to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And even if she's not the same as she used to be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And even if she won't be here all the time..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* It's a good thing Asriel's got someone like you to calm him down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* When he gets excited, he gets REALLY excited."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... or, used to, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I guess it's unfair to think of him as the same person he "
"once was."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With all that stuff he mentioned about trying to corrupt you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With all that stuff he mentioned about hurting you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He's probably a very different person by now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not unlike myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I just hope he can make the best of what he has, now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And that you'll be there for him when he needs you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But I guess I'm starting to repeat myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* We've got a home, we've got sunlight... so there's no reason to "
"complain!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... or something like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Of course they put a microwave in here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Of course they did."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* No doubt that'll be Asriel's primary source of food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, he's what you'd call a \"microwave master.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I mean, it's bad enough that so many of our ingredients are "
"replicated these days..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Formed with matter-energy conversion nonsense, rather than legitimate "
"cooking."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But at least that can still produce something palletable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Using the microwave is just..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's so very wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* I mean, that's just my opinion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* You can feel free to disagree, and knowing you, you probably do..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But some opinions..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Let's just say some opinions are more correct than others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* All we can hope for is that Eurybia has a better selection "
"of fresh ingredients."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Considering Alphys was the one to seek out planets in the first "
"place..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You can't blame me for being at least a little wary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* If Asriel's a microwave master, Alphys would be a microwave "
"overlord."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's all I'm saying."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* No, really."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Won't say anything more."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Not in the kitchen, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The balcony's just outside..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder if the birds are saying anything interesting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Like \"what a nice house!\"\n"
"* Or \"the weather's great today.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Maybe they don't like the house OR the weather.\n"
"* That'd be... kind of sad."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Maybe they're not even birds.\n"
"* Who knows what kinds of sounds birds make here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Who knows if birds even exist here at all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* For all we know, what we're hearing are the cries of the damned buried"
" deep underground."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* After the monsters have lived here long enough, the planet "
"might gain some form of magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If that happens, would the animals be affected, too?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Would they become conscious?\n"
"* Understand us?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Would we understand them?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* If the sounds we're hearing really ARE cries of the damned, I'm not "
"sure I'd want to know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But yeah, planetary magic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I think that's what happened to Krios, when monsters first gained "
"THEIR magic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Either that, or the planet already had magic, and gave it to them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We'd have to ask Terrestria about that sort of thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She'd know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Hey.\n"
"* Don't be nervous about going out there, Frisk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm sure those two would be happy to see you there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And if my analysis of the position is right..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The planet itself will, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't quote me on that, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm not much of a chess player."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* The smartest move I've ever played in a board game was a "
"double-jump in checkers."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It was downhill from there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And if we weren't buried in a jungle, it might be downhill "
"from here, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not that I blame Asgore for choosing such a low-risk location."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He's got two adopted children to think about now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not to mention his own son."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Mountainside living might be cool, but the jungle has its "
"own appeal, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Righty-o.\n"
"* The bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Bathroom bathroom bathroom bathroom bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Bathroom!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Okay... I will admit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It is pretty cool that you've got extra-fluffy shampoo."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Even if it doesn't actually make sense for a human to have it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Unless... you ARE turning into a goat..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... baaah?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* There's a distinct possibility you are not the only one who uses this "
"bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* So this is Monster Kid and Asriel's room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I don't have much to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Though... that poster on the wall is pretty cool."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The old homeworld..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Only now, it's in sepia tone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm honestly not surprised he made this room so much smaller"
" than yours."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* He knows monsters very well.\n"
"* If the bed's comfortable, who cares what room it's in?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not monsters, that's who!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* That must be why Asriel slept in your bed last night as opposed to "
"his."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* From what I can tell..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* This room belonged to someone who spent a long time doing one specific"
" thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If I had that kind of free time, I have no idea what I'd do."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I do know I wouldn't spend it on such a tedious and demoralizingly-"
"large project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But I'm not them, so I wouldn't know what goes through their head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (And yet, despite the sight ahead of you...)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/human}* (... you can't help but feel as if there's something "
"missing.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/3}* Oh, hey Frisk..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I was getting worried you would never wake up!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/3}* ... haha."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* I can't believe I actually..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* ... have..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* I can't believe I actually have a home now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* And with King Asgore!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* All the other kids are gonna want to hang out with us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We'll get to throw house parties ALL the time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/4}* Uh... are you okay?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* I'm kinda worried about you, dude..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Is something wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* Man, the books in the librarby were one thing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/7}* But being on a planet for REAL!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* It's SOOOO much cooler!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Imagine if we tried to explore it all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We'd never EVER be finished!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/4}* (Man, I'm really getting worried now.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Frisk, come on...!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* You gotta say something to me, dude!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* I didn't do anything wrong... did I?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/2}* Aren't you excited?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You and I are gonna do EVERYTHING together!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* Is THIS what living on a planet is like?\n"
"* This is INCREDIBLE!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/10}* What?\n"
"* A whole planet of this?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/20}* Pfft.\n"
"* This is nothing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Just past the forest, there's a giant mountain..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* And a lake beyond that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/2}* That must be the lake with that slimy red goo..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Gross AND awesome!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/1}* ... I dare you to swim."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/7}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/13}* Deal.\n"
"* But only if you swim WITH me!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/21}* Uh... I mean..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* Maybe we'd be better off if we stuck to dune racing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/6}* You're not afraid of getting sticky red goo all over "
"you, are you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/8}* ... ugh, of course not, you idiot, I just-"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/8}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/25}* ... w-wait, I didn't m-mean to..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/4}* Asriel...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/4}* Are you okay?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* ... I..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/22}* I'm alright.\n"
"* You didn't do anything wrong, okay?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/21}* ... you WOULD just forgive me like that, wouldn't "
"you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* You're just an innocent monster kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* That's my name!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/4}* So what were you saying?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/13}* ... there are deserts, but the races would be done in the "
"tubules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/7}* Tubules??\n"
"* What the heck??"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/10}* Uh...\n"
"* Haven't you read the geological surveys?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* What's a geological survey?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/15}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* The tubules are a region made up of... uh, tubes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#f/17}* Large tubes form cliffs, medium tubes form hills, and small "
"tubes, well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* They don't really do much, I guess."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* Oh!\n"
"* That makes sense."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* Do you think there's other planets out there like this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Will we explore those, too?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/10}* Hmm...\n"
"* No doubt there is..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/7}* Yo... what if we formed an exploration group!\n"
"* To travel the stars!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/27}* ... huh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/6}* We'd start with this world, and find everything we "
"can..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* Then we'd visit more worlds, and make a huge map of the"
" whole galaxy!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/kidd}{#f/13}* And we should TOTALLY have a secret handshake!\n"
"* Like Gerson's!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* With any luck, we'll be hand-in-hand with other "
"galaxies' races, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* With any luck, we'll be making maps of other "
"galaxies, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/13}* Dr. Alphys's wormhole travel gives us the means to visit them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* We'd be a pan-galactic exploration group."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/17}* Woah, uh, slow down there kiddo..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/17}* ... a secret handshake would be pretty cool, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* ... as for exploring other planets..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#f/13}* It took us long enough just to make it here, let alone another "
"world."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/kidd}{#f/14}* Oh yeah, I totally forgot about that!\n"
"* We've GOTTA try that!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/3}* Haha. Maybe.\n"
"* But we could still totally explore it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/17}* Just us, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* Totally, dude!\n"
"* Just the three of us!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... uh, don't you mean \"the four of us?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/25}* ...!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/25}* $(name)... you're..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... wait, NOW you can hear me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I tried reaching out to you before, but... it didn't work."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what changed..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/6}* Haha. If you're friends with him, then you're friends "
"with me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Wait, YOU can hear me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* Kind of hard not to when you're standing there, y'know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* YOU CAN SEE ME!?!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh... my god..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* Asriel, how did you not notice me standing here?\n"
"* I'm not even hidden!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asriel1}{#f/23}* ... $(name), I..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Asriel, it's okay.\n"
"* You don't have to be ashamed of it anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If you need to cry..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... you can."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Having that extra SOUL inside of me must've made it hard to "
"appear visually..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Back on the outpost, when I did finally manage to do it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That very same SOUL was released shortly after."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... I guess this means I'll be visible all the time now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* To be honest, I'm not sure how to feel about that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/7}* Wait, are you a human too!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Excuse me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* I'm a human GHOST who wants their GOAT brother to be happy.\n"
"* Get it right. Sheesh."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/14}* ... Asriel is your BROTHER!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/4}* This is too much..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
