msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Why?\n"
"* Just a feeling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I was one of the builders of the ORIGINAL fountain "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Y'know.\n"
"* Before Mettaton decided to rebuild the whole thing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Like, who does that? Who'd rebuild it all just to change a single, "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of petty if you ask me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I can't BELIEVE Mettaton's running his TV shows when"
" there's a killer on the loose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Does he not see how dangerous that could be?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Someone's going to end up getting killed doing that nonsense."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of idiotic if you ask me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Like, really, people?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Did you seriously think I'd want to run away like that?"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"
"* I've never been one for parties."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* My main hobbies and interests consist primarily..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... of pointing out and picking apart poor imitations."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Like this fountain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* As far as I'm concerned, this is all his fault."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He got too over-confident, and he paid the price."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Too bad, so sad, be glad I'm not your dad."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* The more he stays out of our lives, the better."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'd ask him never to show up again, but..."

msgid "<32>* ... then I wouldn't have anything to be upset about."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, he was in charge of the original build project here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But now... he sells moon rocks for a living."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"
"* I'm standing out here, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So I guess I'm just as guilty."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Embarrassing, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Pointless, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ironic, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Finally got outta school, I don't know why I still "

msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/5}* He said he was \"done chasing fantasies\" or something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* He said he was \"done seeking love\" or whatever."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* Kinda sounds like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* Sorta feels like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/8}* He TOTALLY saw us as a fantasy."

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/2/6}* I wonder what they'll have to say about that \"archive\" "

msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* Yeah, THAT thing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* Isn't that where Asgore was keeping ALL the humans?"

msgid "<16>* Oh my god, ALPHYS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/8}* She used to live in our housing spire!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* She was like a big sister!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* I mean, like, if your big sister..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/2}* ... takes you on rip- roaring interstellar trash hunts!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* She showed us the coolest ways to find stuff."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* She built up a WICKED sci-fi collection."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* Then she became the royal scientist..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/0/5}* ... she doesn't really have time for trash-hunting anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/6}* So Alphys has always been, like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* ... super duper smart."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* Like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* UNNATURALLY smart."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* Like, she can calculate a derivative in her head..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/2}* ... in five seconds FLAT!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* It's MEGA impressive and all..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/2/5}* ... but as a result, she struggles with her impulses "
"sometimes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/1/6}* I remember that time she called in half the Royal Guard..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/4}* ... when she thought she saw some \"interesting trash.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* It's like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* She doesn't process things the way most people do."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/8}* But we love her for that, don't we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* But we still think she's A-MAZ-ING!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/4/0}* So like... OBVIOUSLY Asgore made her the royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/2}* Oh, for sure!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* Oh right, THAT goofy goober."
msgstr ""

msgid "<17>{#k/0/8}* Oh yeah, THAT furry fuzzball!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/0}* So like, here's the thing about Asgore..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* ... he's one of the NICEST guys you'll ever meet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/0}* But, at the same time..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/4/5}* ... it's kind of gross."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* ... it's just plain awful."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* I heard Undyne lobbied to expand the Royal Guard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/2/6}* Yeah, didn't Asgore, like, not even want one to begin with?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/4}* ... the stuff you've been up to out there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/4/5}* ... well, it's making his job a little tougher."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>* ... well, it's making his life a little harder."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* Like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/2/6}* ... maybe try NOT to kill anyone else, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<16>{#k/3/6}* Gosh.\n"

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/8}* Catty, no!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* Hey, there's no need to be afraid of him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/1}* Yeah, he's WAY too adorable for that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/5/1}* Way too adorable!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<16>{#k/0/0}* Hey, I'm sure he'll understand why you did what you did."
