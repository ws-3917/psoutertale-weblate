msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* You know, it's kinda cool you went with THAT "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Hot cocoa..."

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* This one time, after the CORE malfunctioned..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* No heat, very little air... it got colder, and colder..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Then, Asgore came over and offered me a hot cocoa."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* We sat together in this very room..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* You know, it's kinda weird you ended up liking THAT "

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Starling flower tea..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That's always been Asgore's favorite kind."

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* You kinda remind me of him."

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/1}* You're the only two people who've actually managed to beat me!"

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* You're both TOTAL weenies!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ... sort of."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* The thing is, I was a pretty hot-headed kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Once, to prove I was the strongest, I tried to fight Asgore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Emphasis on TRIED."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I could barely land a single blow on him!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* And worse, the whole time, he refused to fight back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I was so humiliated..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Afterwards, he apologized and said something goofy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* \"Excuse me, do you want to know how to beat me?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I said yes, and from then on, he trained me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* One day, during practice, I finally knocked him down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I felt... bad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* But he was beaming..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/1}* I had never seen someone more proud to get their butt kicked."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Anyway, long story short, after completing my training..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* I took up leadership of the Royal Guard!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* So I'm the one who gets to train dorks to fight!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ... like, uh, Papyrus."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* But, um, to be honest..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ... I don't know if..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I can ever let Papyrus into the Royal Guard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Don't tell him I said that!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/10}* He's just...\n"
"* Well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I mean, it's not that he's stupid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* His attack designs are actually pretty freaking wild!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/10}* It's just that...\n"
"* He's..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* He's too innocent and nice!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* I mean, look, he was SUPPOSED to capture you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}* And he ended up being FRIENDS with you instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* I could NEVER send him into battle!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* He'd get ripped into little smiling shreds."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* That's part of why..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* I started teaching him how to cook, you know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* So, um, maybe he can do something else with his life."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Oh, sorry, I was talking for so long..."

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* Oh, sorry, I was talking for so long..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW!!!"

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE IT FOR HIM!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That's right!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* NOTHING has brought Papyrus and I closer than cooking!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE US AFTER THIS!"

msgid ""
"<33>{#k/3}* I myself grew up in a quiet little town outside the city.\n"

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/4}* Every few days, some of the kids from school would host these "
"time trial races."

"<32>{#k/0}* The weather wasn't always friendly, but they didn't care.\n"
"* If anything, it just made things more interesting."

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/0}* I was an insignificant country bumpkin, but he saw somethin' in "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/4}* One thing led to another, and I ended up moving away from my "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/3}* ... that was the last time I'd ever get to see them face to "

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/2}* If you haven't, then what asteroid have ya been living in for "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/3}* Under his reign, the monster species came so far.\n"
"* Perhaps a little too far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/0}* He was so happy to meet a human for the first time... but not "

"<32>{#k/1}* Nah, that was his son's wish.\n"
"* Poor kid got exactly what he asked for and then some..."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#k/3}* Forgive me, but I don't really wanna talk about that "

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/3}* Well, y'know what?\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* One attack from you, and then I'd... well..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/4}* At least by talking to you, I've bought enough time for some of "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* Those folks can't get enough of their engineering jobs!"

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* Boy, I sure hope that doesn't happen to you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Well, it's never been the friendliest location..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/3}* From the humans sending us here to die, to the recent loss of a "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Nothin' but bad luck down here, kiddo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/2}* Well, back when we first got trapped out here, this WAS the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/0}* All those fancy-schmancy sections added on afterwards were built"
" by us monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/0}* Turns out most people aren't into the idea of living in the past.\n"
"* Fair enough."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/2}* But... I just think there's something so decadent about "
"repurposing this place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/3}* It was the humans who trapped us here, hoping we'd rot and "
"suffer in darkness."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#k/0}* But look at us now.\n"
"* Look at how we've made this place our own."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
