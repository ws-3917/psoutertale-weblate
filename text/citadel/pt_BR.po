msgid "<25>* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* maybe that's for the best."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* but i do know that for you to have done all this..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* i'll bet somewhere, deep down, you really do care about us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* you certainly cared enough to make it this far, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i know. the whole \"appeal to emotion\" isn't really my"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* but what else am i supposed to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* when someone goes as far as you have..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* intimidation just doesn't seem appropriate anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* so i'm trying something different."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#f/3}* now.\n"
"* if this is really how it ends..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* so be it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* kindness isn't exactly your thing, and i get that."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* then why not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* just this once, just at the end..."
