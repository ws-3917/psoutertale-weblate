WE WERE STICKING TO THE ORIGINAL DAILY ROUTINE OF KRIS AS WE ARE STILL EXPERIMENTING WITH SUSTAINED HOST CONTROL.\n\none day, KRIS ENTERED THEIR SCHOOL CLASSROOM AS USUAL AND WAS TASKED WITH FETCHING CHALK FROM THE SCHOOL'S SUPPLY CLOSET ALONGSIDE \"SUSIE.\"\n\nNORMALLY, KRIS WOULD SIMPLY WALK TO THE SUPPLY CLOSET AND GRAB A SINGLE PIECE OF CHALK. ADDITIONALLY, SUSIE WOULD CONSUME THE REST OF THE CHALK IN THE BOX, LEAVING HER CLOTHES COVERED IN DUST AND REVEALING HER ODD HABIT TO EVERYONE.\n\nNOT THIS TIME.

SOMEHOW, THE SUPPLY CLOSET CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO EXIST. THIS IS INTERESTING SINCE WE HAVE NOT CHANGED ANY OF OUR PROCEDURES FOR KRIS WHEN RUNNING THE SIMULATION FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD. WHY HAS THIS CHANGED SUDDENLY?\n\nADVENTURING OUT OF BOUNDS AGAIN, WE ARE NO LONGER MET WITH A CRASH WHEN KRIS AWAKENS.

This should be amazing- all the exploration and information we can gain will skyrocket!\n\nBut then again, why should we care?\n\nThis isn't the big picture.

They usually prioritize stronger, healthier entities to ensure the host is as optimal as possible for testing.\n\nMy hypothetical aimed to test this: what if a weak monster was chosen for host control?\n\nFor the first few days, all was fine. We had documented this entity's daily routine and followed it as usual. Around day 3, the entity fainted from exhaustion and only woke up after they extracted the host control.

In early iterations, with \"Kris\" under the influence of the host and mimicking their day-to-day life, no discernible differences in their peers' actions were detected.\n\nAdditionally, there have been no traces of \"Kris\" attempting to disrupt the host.\n\n\"Kris\" will be the primary candidate going forward.",
