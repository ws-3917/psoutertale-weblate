They usually prioritize stronger, healthier entities to ensure the host is as optimal as possible for testing.\n\nMy hypothetical aimed to test this: what if a weak monster was chosen for host control?\n\nFor the first few days, all was fine. We had documented this entity's daily routine and followed it as usual. Around day 3, the entity fainted from exhaustion and only woke up after they extracted the host control.

In early iterations, with \"Kris\" under the influence of the host and mimicking their day-to-day life, no discernible differences in their peers' actions were detected.\n\nAdditionally, there have been no traces of \"Kris\" attempting to disrupt the host.\n\n\"Kris\" will be the primary candidate going forward.",
