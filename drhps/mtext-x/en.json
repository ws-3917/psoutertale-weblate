SOMEHOW, THE SUPPLY CLOSET CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO EXIST. THIS IS INTERESTING SINCE WE HAVE NOT CHANGED ANY OF OUR PROCEDURES FOR KRIS WHEN RUNNING THE SIMULATION FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD. WHY HAS THIS CHANGED SUDDENLY?\n\nADVENTURING OUT OF BOUNDS AGAIN, WE ARE NO LONGER MET WITH A CRASH WHEN KRIS AWAKENS. INSTEAD, WE FIND THE SAME PECULIAR ENVIRONMENT, ALONGSIDE MANY CHANGES TO KRIS'S APPEARANCE.\n\nBEFORE, THEY WORE A SIMPLE GREEN AND YELLOW SWEATER. NOW, THEY ARE WEARING A FULL SET OF ARMOR. ADVENTURING FORWARD, WE LOCATED \"SUSIE\" AS WELL. IT APPEARS THIS ENTITY'S APPEARANCE HAS ALSO CHANGED. \"SUSIE\" BEHAVES AS SHE NORMALLY WOULD, TAKING IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT WITH A REALISTIC DEMEANOR.\n\nTHIS WORLD APPEARS TO BE INTENTIONALLY GENERATED BY THE SIMULATION AND NOT THE RESULT OF ANY EXTERNAL MALFUNCTION.\n\nTHIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE PERFORMANCE ISSUES WE'VE ENCOUNTERED IN THE PAST.

This should be amazing- all the exploration and information we can gain will skyrocket!\n\nBut then again, why should we care?\n\nThis isn't the big picture.

They usually prioritize stronger, healthier entities to ensure the host is as optimal as possible for testing.\n\nMy hypothetical aimed to test this: what if a weak monster was chosen for host control?\n\nFor the first few days, all was fine. We had documented this entity's daily routine and followed it as usual. Around day 3, the entity fainted from exhaustion and only woke up after they extracted the host control.

In early iterations, with \"Kris\" under the influence of the host and mimicking their day-to-day life, no discernible differences in their peers' actions were detected.\n\nAdditionally, there have been no traces of \"Kris\" attempting to disrupt the host.\n\n\"Kris\" will be the primary candidate going forward.",
